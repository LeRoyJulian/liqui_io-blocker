Block assholes from Liqui.io
To install it, go to Chrome Extensions, check Developer Mode On, drag and drop the file there, then verify it’s activated.
Refresh Liqui then you’re good to go! Check the source code before installing if you don't trust me, there’s only two files and it's only javascript! 
With it you’ll get rid of this spamming asshole! 

Bryan sucks.
