Block assholes from Liqui.io!
To install it, go to Chrome Extensions, check Developer Mode On, drag and drop the folder there, then verify it’s activated.
Click on the icon, open options, then choose who to mute! Refresh Liqui then you’re good to go!
Check the source code before installing if you don't trust me, it's only javascript!
